# JSX and Basic Syntax

JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to JavaScript syntax that allows XML-like code to be written directly within JavaScript. It's commonly used in React for defining the structure of UI components.

## Understanding JSX

JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to visualize and define UI components.

## JSX vs. HTML

While JSX resembles HTML syntax, it's important to note that JSX is not HTML. JSX gets transformed into JavaScript objects before being rendered by the browser.

## JSX Expressions

JSX expressions can be embedded within curly braces `{}` to evaluate JavaScript expressions and variables within JSX code.
